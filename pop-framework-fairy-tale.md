# POP framework fairy tale

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away Unix was born ...

There is a legend about Grand Master Peter H. Salus and his version of Unix
Philosophy:

> * Write programs that do one thing and do it well
> * Write programs to work together
> * Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface


Later **O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming was born. However after OOP glory
days the rise of the Web, SaaS, and Open Source was to begun ...

The time for **P**lugin **O**riented **P**rogramming has come. Grand Master
Thomas S Hatch once said:

> * Write programs that do one thing and do it well
> * Write programs to work together
> * Write programs to expose interfaces that can be easily merged together
