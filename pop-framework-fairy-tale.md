# POP framework fairy tale

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away Unix was born ...

There is a history about Grand Master Peter H. Salus and his version of *Unix
Philosophy*:

> * Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
> * Write programs to work together.
> * Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.


*But the hearts of men are easily corrupted ...* **O**bject **O**riented
**P**rogramming was born. *Some things that should not have been forgotten were
lost* ... *History about __Unix Philosophy__ became legend, legend became myth
...*

Until when chance came: the rise of the Web, SaaS, and Open Source

The time for **P**lugin **O**riented **P**rogramming has come. Grand Master
Thomas S Hatch said:

> * Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
> * Write programs to work together.
> * Write programs to expose interfaces that can be easily merged together.
