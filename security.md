# Security grab-bag

[The Rugged Manifesto](https://ruggedsoftware.org/)
> I am rugged and, more importantly, my code is rugged.
> I recognize that software has become a foundation of our modern world.
> I recognize the awesome responsibility that comes with this foundational role.
> I recognize that my code will be used in ways I cannot anticipate, in ways it was not designed, and for longer than it was ever intended.
> I recognize that my code will be attacked by talented and persistent adversaries who threaten our physical, economic, and national security.
> I recognize these things - and I choose to be rugged.
> I am rugged because I refuse to be a source of vulnerability or weakness.
> I am rugged because I assure my code will support its mission.
> I am rugged because my code can face these challenges and persist in spite of them.
> I am rugged, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary and I am up for the challenge.

* (AWS re:Invent 2020) Ten easy and effective ways to secure your AWS
  environment:
  1. Amazon S3 Block Public Access
  2. Use federation - make all your IAM credentials temporary
  3. Collect AWS CloudTrail for your entire AWS organization
  4. Know how to query a CloudTrail
  5. Tag your subnets for scalable control over connectivity
  6. Centrally manage network security with AWS Firewall Manager
  7. Assert network origin in your AWS IAM policies
  8. Use the network to keep your data where you want
  9. Connect to your Amazon EC2 instances without SSH keys: do this `aws ssm
     start-session --target i-01234567` instead of `ssh user@host`
  10. Monitor DNS from your VPC with Amazon Route 53 Resolver Query Logging
